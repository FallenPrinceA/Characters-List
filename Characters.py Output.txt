The story that is my all time favorite is I met the devil while working the Night Shift it was about a man who met the Devil who tried to tempt him for his soul, had a really good twist!
The story that stuck with me the most is I met God, the Grim Reaper, and the Devil on the Same Day it was one of my all time favorites and is about a man who died and has to meet God and the Devil to decide if he wanted to go to Heaven or Hell.
This story I'm a retired ex priest had the best twist and was about a priest who found out he was the anti-christ.
This story The Devil Game was about how to summon the Devil and had a horror twist at the end.
This story was very tragic The Girl the Universe Forgot it was about a girl who was forgotten due to a strange paranormal anomaly that erased her from the Universe.
